# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS EXCEL)
 
## Project objective
We need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in MS EXCEL to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving services.

## Dateset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/abhishekp-786/Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Hospital%20Emergency%20Room%20Set.csv">Dataset</a>
## Question(KPIs)
- Patient Admission Status: Show how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted.

- Patient Age Distribution: Group patients by age.

- Timeliness: Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.

- Gender Analysis: Display the number of patients by gender. 

- Department Referrals: Check which departments patients are referred to the most.
- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/abhishekp-786/Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-03-30%20153033.png">View Dashboard</a>
## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot into one dashboad and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Conclusion
-The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard enhances efficiency by tracking admissions, age distribution, timeliness, gender demographics, and department referrals. It helps optimize resource allocation, reduce wait times, and improve patient care. These insights enable hospitals to make data-driven decisions for better emergency response and overall healthcare management.
